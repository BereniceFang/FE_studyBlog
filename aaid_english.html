      <h2>Why do you see ads?</h2>
      <p>Advertising revenue is the vital source of income for developers. Without ads, they won't be able to create and support free apps and services.</p>
      <p>We do our best to provide you with useful and informative ads, so you could find the products and services you need faster.</p>

      <h2>What's Xiaomi's approach to advertising?</h2>
      <p>Constantly improving user experience is our core goal. That's why we refuse to work with aggressive advertising, and always strive to show you the ad content that might be useful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="context-card">
      <h2>How does Xiaomi use your data?</h2>
      <p>In order to protect your privacy, we use anonymous advertising identifier to enhance the relevance of the ads shown to you. It means that the data we use isn't associated with you personally. The goal of the advertising identifier is to help us group people according to their interests. In other words, we use this tool to define target audiences for specific types of ads you will receive. There'll be at least 10,000 people in every group you're a part of. </p>

      <h2>Turning off personalized ads</h2>
      <p>You can turn personalized ads off. In MIUI 8, go to Settings > Additional settings > Ad services to do that.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi won't show personalized ads after you turn off the anonymous advertising identifier.</p>
      <p>To delete all data related to ad services, go to Settings > Additional settings > Ad services, and reset the identifier.</p>
